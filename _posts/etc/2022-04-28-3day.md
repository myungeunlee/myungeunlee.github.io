#### SITUATION 1
제가 새 랩탑이 하나 필요했는데 인터넷에 싸게 나온게 있어서 하나를 주문했어요.  
**근데 그걸 배송하는 택배회사가 코로나 때문에 물류창고를 몇 군데 닫은 모양이더라고요.**  
이제 일주일 됐는데 좀 더 걸릴 것 같아요.  

- 그것을 배송하는 택배회사: 관계절
- 물류창고를 몇 군데: 물류창고 중 몇 군데 -> (양/개수) of 물류창고, many of 무엇/a few of 무엇
- 물류창고: distribution warehouse
- 닫은: 현재완료 시제
- apparently: 사실인지는 모르겠으나 전해들은 바에 의하면
- 일주일 됐다: 일주일이다 + 현재완료 시제
- (앞으로) 어떻게 될 것 같다: 의견보다 추측이라면-> 어때 보인다.

##### 토들러 영작
I needed a new laptop and I found a good deal online so I ordered one.  
But **apparently,** the delivery company that is shipping it **has closed down** a few of their distribution warehouses becasue of the pandemic.  
It has been a week now but it looks like it's going to take a little longer.  


#### SITUATION 2

When I was little, both of my parents had to work.  
So, I **didn't get to** go home right after school. I had to stay at a daycare center for several hours. But it wasn't all bad. I got to meet a lot of new friends.  
> I couldn't ..: (단순히) 못했다.
I didn't get to: 못해서 아쉬웠다.
