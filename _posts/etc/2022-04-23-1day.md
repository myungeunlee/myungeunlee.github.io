A: Do you live with your parents?  
B: No. I live alone.

B: Sure, I get lonely sometimes.    //of course의 경우는 살짝 안맞음   
    But I keep myself pretty busy so I'm not at home a lot. //꽤 바쁘게 지내서 집에 잘 안있어요.

I went to the electronics store yesterday to get a humidifier for my office   
I usually decide pretty quickly when I'm shopping but, oh my gosh, there were so many different kinds.  
I must have looked through the entire store like a dozen times.
